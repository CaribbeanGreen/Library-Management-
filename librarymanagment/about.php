<h1>Library Book<br> Management System</h1>
<p class='first'>The primary propose of this project is to streamline and simplify the process of borrowing books by transforming the traditional</p> 
<p>library book borrowing system into a digital web-based platform. By digitizing the library management process, we aim to enhance the efficiency </p>
<p>and user experience for both library staff and customer. The digital system will facilitate various library functions, such as searching for books,</p> 
<p>checking their availability, managing user accounts, and processing book loans and returns. This will reduce manual workload, minimize errors,</p> 
<p>and provide a more accessible and convenient way for users to interact with library resources.  </p>
